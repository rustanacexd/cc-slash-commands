# Review Work Progress Against PRD
# Purpose: Deep review of completed work against PRD requirements and corresponding task lists with thorough analysis

## Command Overview
This command performs a comprehensive review of work done against a specific PRD and its corresponding task list. It uses deep analysis ("ultrathinking") to ensure quality, completeness, and alignment with the original requirements.

## Command Usage

```
/review-work prd-[feature-name].md
```

Example:
- `/review-work prd-user-auth.md` - Reviews work against user authentication PRD

## File Resolution

The command automatically resolves related files:
- PRD file: `prd-[feature-name].md` (provided by user)
- Task file: `tasks-prd-[feature-name].md` (automatically deduced)
- Both files are expected in the `/tasks/` directory

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

1. **Load PRD Requirements:**
   - Parse the provided PRD file
   - Extract all functional requirements
   - Note user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Identify success metrics

2. **Load Task List:**
   - Automatically find `tasks-prd-[feature-name].md`
   - Parse all parent tasks and sub-tasks
   - Check completion status of each item
   - Note any additional tasks added during development

3. **Analyze Work Done:**
   - Review git history for related commits
   - Identify all files created or modified
   - Check test results and coverage
   - Review any documentation created

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis (Ultrathinking)

For **EACH** PRD requirement and task item, perform thorough analysis:

#### A. PRD Requirement Verification
**For each functional requirement in the PRD:**
- **Requirement:** What was specified?
- **Implementation:** How was it implemented?
- **Completeness:** Is it fully implemented?
- **Edge Cases:** Are all scenarios covered?
- **User Stories:** Does it satisfy the related user stories?
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Does it meet all criteria?

#### B. Task Completion Analysis
**For each task in the task list:**
- **Task Status:** Is it marked complete?
- **Evidence:** What proof exists of completion?
- **Quality:** How well was it executed?
- **Dependencies:** Were prerequisite tasks completed first?
- **Testing:** Was it properly tested and validated?

#### C. Cross-Reference Check
- **Coverage:** Does every PRD requirement have corresponding tasks?
- **Alignment:** Do completed tasks fulfill PRD requirements?
- **Gaps:** Are there PRD requirements without implementation?
- **Extras:** Was work done beyond PRD scope?

#### D. Quality Deep Dive
Think deeply about:
- **Correctness:** Does the solution solve the actual problem stated in the PRD?
- **Robustness:** Will this handle production load and edge cases?
- **Maintainability:** Is the code clean and maintainable?
- **Performance:** Are there performance implications?
- **Security:** Have security requirements been met?
- **Scalability:** Will this scale as the product grows?
- **Technical Debt:** What debt was introduced?
- **Integration:** How well does it integrate with existing systems?
- **User Experience:** Does it deliver the intended UX from the PRD?

# Work Review: User Authentication Feature

## üìã PRD Requirements Review

### Requirement #1: Users must be able to register with email/password
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Implementation:** Implemented in /api/auth/register endpoint using bcrypt for password hashing
**Evidence:**

- Unit tests passing: auth.test.js:45-67
- Database shows users table with hashed passwords

**Deep Analysis:**
- Fully meets requirement? Yes - registration flow complete
- Edge cases handled?
  ‚úÖ Duplicate email check
  ‚úÖ Password strength validation
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing rate limiting for registration attempts
- Performance: Fast (~200ms response time)
- Security: Bcrypt with 10 rounds, could increase for production
- Maintenance: Clean code, well-structured

## Special Considerations

- If PRD file doesn't exist, provide clear error message
- If task file doesn't exist, offer to review against PRD only
- If neither file exists, offer to review based on git history
- Handle partially completed work gracefully
- Highlight any work done outside PRD scope
